# trust-in-illicit-markets

This project explores how trust and reputation operate in darknet drug marketplaces using a dataset of 4,033 darknet sales reviews. We analyze vendor experience and DEA drug scheduling classifications to test how they influence pricing and trust signals. Our methods include text parsing, clustering, and sentiment analysis of reviews to uncover patterns in reputation-building within anonymous online communities.
